# Sober at Dal – Open Source for Recovery & Community Support

Sober at Dal is a student-led support community at Dalhousie University dedicated to fostering a safe, inclusive, and judgment-free space for individuals navigating sobriety and recovery. We provide peer support, resources, and social alternatives to substance use while promoting well-being, resilience, and personal growth. But our mission doesn’t stop there—we believe in open-source solutions to make recovery and mental health support more accessible, adaptable, and community-driven.

🚀 Our Open-Source Work

We contribute to and maintain open-source projects that empower individuals in recovery, raise awareness about mental health, and build digital tools to support sober communities.
